# Webmin 1.890 expired Remote Root

## CVE-2019-15107

Webmin version **1.890** was released with a backdoor that could allow anyone with knowledge of it to execute commands as root. Versions 1.900 to 1.920 also contained a backdoor using similar code, but it was not exploitable in a default Webmin install. Only if the admin had enabled the feature at Webmin -> Webmin Configuration -> Authentication to allow changing of expired passwords could it be used by an attacker.
